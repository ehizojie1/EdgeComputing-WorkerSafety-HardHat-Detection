# Create a dashboard

In this part of the workshop you will begin to create your Hard Hat Detection application.

## Dashboard Layouts

The Dashboard uses a grid based layout. Widgets, such as buttons or text boxes, are
given a size in grid-cells. They are packed into a group that has a defined width.
The Groups are then placed on a Tab - laid out using a flow-based layout, filling
the width of the page before wrapping. This arrangement provides some flexibility
in how the page displays on different screen sizes.

## Dashboard Sidebar

Within the editor, the Dashboard module provides a sidebar where you can customize
its features as well as manage its tabs, groups and widgets.

1. Open the Dashboard sidebar
2. Click the `+ tab` button to create a new tab.
3. Hover over the newly added tab and click the `edit` button.

       ![](../images/db-sidebar.png){: style="width: 250px"}

4. In the edit dialog, give the tab a name of `AI Photo Booth` and click Update
   to close the dialog.
5. Hover over the tab again and click the `+ group` button.
6. Edit the new group and set its properties:

       ![](../images/db-group.png){: style="width: 250px"}

    - Set the name to 'WebCam'
    - Set the width to `10` by clicking the button and dragging the box out to 10
      units wide.
    - Untick the 'Display group name' option

       ![](../images/db-group-edit.png){: style="width: 300px"}

This has created the initial layout components needed for the dashboard. You can
now start to add content.




## Next Steps

The next task is to [add some different controls to the dashboard](adding-controls.md).
